With denomination of origin in 9 regions of Mexico, Oaxaca produces more than 80% at the national level. Mezcal production directly impacts the welfare of rural communities, generating opportunities and sources of dignified employment for thousands of families, keeping them united, without the need to emigrate to seek better sources of income. Mezcal is much more than a spirituous beverage, it is present in places, in memories, in stories, in music, in gastronomy. Thanks to revaluation and dignification work, mezcal has currently gained ground in the world of cocktails and beverages, making its presence felt throughout the world."
